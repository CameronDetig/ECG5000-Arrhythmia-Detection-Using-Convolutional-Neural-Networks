Convolutional Neural Network intended for 5-class classification of ECG heart beat recordings.

Uses the ECG5000 Dataset from https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG5000
A version of this dataset is incuded under the ECG_5000_Dataset folder.

Recommended to use Python 3.10
Create a .venv and install all libraries in requirements.txt
